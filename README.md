# Fast marching tree
This repository currently includes fast marching tree (FMT)[1] implementation in Julia. Specifically, The implementation is for double integrator system [2]. I like FMT algorithm for its simpleness and speed compared to rather complex RRT* algorithm. And, this is kind of my missionary activity for FMT. The GIF below was made by concatenating data generated by this `example.jl` in this repository.

I'm a newbie in Julia, so I welcome any suggestion about everything. But please note that even a code written by a newbie is that fast.
